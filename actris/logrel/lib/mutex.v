(** This file defines a new semantic type former [mutex A], which is the type of
mutexes containing a value of type [A]. Mutexes are copyable, regardless of
whether the type contained in them is copyable. This makes them very useful for
sharing affine resources (such as channels) between multiple threads.
Internally, mutexes are implemented using a spin lock and a mutable reference.
The operations for spin locks that are used by the mutex are defined in Iris.

The following operations are supported on mutexes:
- [mutex_alloc]: Takes a value and wraps it in a mutex.
- [mutex_acquire]: Acquire the mutex and return the value contained in it.
- [mutex_release]: Release the mutex, storing a given value in it.

The typing rules for these operations additionally contain a type
[mutexguard A], which represents a mutex that has been acquired. The typing
rules for the operations require the [mutex] or [mutexguard] to be in a variable
(i.e., let-bound), and the type of this variable in the typing context changes
as the mutex is acquired and released.

It is only possible to release a mutex after it has been opened. The
[mutexguard A] is not copyable, since that would allow a mutex to be released
multiple times after acquiring it once.

This type former is strongly inspired by the [Mutex] type in the standard
library of Rust, which has also been semantically modelled in the LambdaRust
project.
