(** This file contains the definitions of the semantic interpretations of the
term type formers of the type system. The semantic interpretation of a type
(former) is a unary Iris predicate on values [val → iProp], which determines
when a value belongs to a certain type.

The following types are defined:
- [unit], [bool], [int]: basic types for unit, Boolean and integer values,
  respectively.
- [any]: inhabited by all values.
- [A ⊸ B]: the type of affine functions from [A] to [B]. Affine functions can
  only be invoked once, since they might have captured affine resources.
- [A → B]: the type of non-affine (copyable) functions from [A] to [B]. These
  can be invoked any number of times. This is simply syntactic sugar for
  [copy (A ⊸ B)].
- [A * B], [A + B], [∀ X, A], [∃ X, A]: products, sums, universal types,
  existential types.
- [copy A]: inhabited by those values in the type [A] which are copyable. In the
  case of functions, for instance, functions (closures) which capture affine
  resources are not copyable, whereas functions that do not capture resources are.
- [copy- A]: acts as a kind of "inverse" to [copy A]. More precisely, we have
  that [copy- (copy A) :> A]. This type is used to indicate the results of
  operations that might consume a resource, but do not always do so, depending
  on whether the type [A] is copyable. Such operations result in a [copy- A],
  which can be turned into an [A] using subtyping when [A] is copyable.
- [ref_uniq A]: the type of uniquely-owned mutable references to a value of type [A].
  Since the reference is guaranteed to be unique, it is possible for the type [A]
  contained in the reference to change to a different type [B] by assigning to
  the reference.
- [chan P]: the type of channels, governed by the session type [P].

In addition, some important properties, such as contractivity and
non-expansiveness of these type formers is proved. This is important in order to
use these type formers to define recursive types. *)
